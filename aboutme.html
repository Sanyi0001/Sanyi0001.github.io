			<h1>About me</h1>
		</div>
		
		<div class="left">
			<h2>Past</h2>
			<div>I followed the standard Hungarian education path. After that, I could choose between mathematics and informatics. I preferred mathematics over informatics because I thought it could give me the basics of logical thinking that I will need during this course. After high school, I decided to go to the Netherlands and attend to the HZ university</div>
		</div>
		<div class="middle">
			<h2>Now</h2>
			<div>I favor small universities over the huge ones because you are not just a number in the teachers' system. Another advantage is that HZ is a practical university, not a theoretical one. In my opinion, it is essential to do practice over the years you spend in the university to be able to find a job quite fast. I am planning to study at HZ for four years. During these four years, I would like to go to a company and have an internship. They can teach you the newest things since they can easily buy the most expensive equipment. They typically have more workforce, so probably they can assign an employee to help the intern. </div>
		</div>  
		<div class="right">
			<h2>Future</h2>
			<div>After these four years, I would like to go to a startup company to expand my horizon and learn new things. After that, it would be nice to work for a fintech company because I am quite interested in those companies' business part as well. </div>
