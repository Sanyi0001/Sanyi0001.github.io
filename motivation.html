				<h2>What is motivation?</h2>
				<p>According to Kendra Cherry, motivation is our "engine" that helps us towards our goals. That is why we have goal-oriented behavior. 
					In everyday usage, the motivation describes why someone is doing something. What is his/her reason?
					But in-depth motivation is much more than this.  Psychologists tried to come up with ideas about what lies behind the motivations for why we act? One of the most proven ones is Maslow's hierarchy of needs. (Kendra Cherry 27.04.2020)</p>

				<p>According to Saul McLeod, Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a motivational theory in psychology, comprising a five-tier model of human needs, often depicted as hierarchical levels within a pyramid.
					Needs lower down in the hierarchy must be satisfied before individuals can attend to needs higher up. From the bottom of the hierarchy upwards, the needs are physiological, safety, love and belonging, esteem, and self-actualization. As we are moving upwards, our motivation increases as needs are met. (Saul McLeod 20.03.2020)</p>
				<h2>Types of motivation</h2>
				<p>There are two main kinds of motivation: extrinsic and intrinsic.
					Extrinsic motivations: outside of the individual, most of the time involve rewards like money or social recognition. It can involve punishments as well.
					Intrinsic motivations come from the individual itself, like editing Wikipedia in order to help others. It is for something more significant than the individual.<a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/explore-elt/0/steps/15701">Future Learn</a></p>
				<h2>Recap</h2>
					<p>Motivation is an essential factor in reaching goals. Working towards a goal involves different steps. First, the person thinks about what he/she wants to achieve and the purpose behind setting the objective. It is advised to divide the overarching goal into a series of tiny, precise, measurable tasks. This way, the overall goal becomes more available because it is always simpler to reach smaller ones than one huge. It is also required to work one way up from more accessible to more challenging tasks; otherwise, the person will feel exhausted at the beginning of the process and become tired soon.</p>
					<h2>Candle problem</h2>
					<p>The candle problem is about the following: A person has to attach a candle to the wall in order to make sure that the wax will not drip onto the table. The individual gets a candle thumbtacks and matches. Many people usually try to solve the problem using different methods/ideas, but none of them work. The solution is to defeat "functional fixedness." The box is not only the holder of the items you got but also could function as a platform for a candle.</p>
					<p>Sam Glucksberg researched motivation and found the following: If someone tries to motivate an individual with punishments or rewarding, it will only increase that individual's performance if the task needs no creativity. If it does need creativity, it will do the exact opposite: decreases the performance. He states that the rewards narrow the focus and block creativity. He believes that this extrinsic motivational system, what many businesses apply nowadays, is outdated and harmful. According to him, today's white-collar workers need creativity more than ever, because those task witch does not require creativity easily can be automatized. Therefore there is no human interaction there required.</p>
					<p>He states that the best motivation is an intrinsic one when someone is passionate about something and motivated from the inside.
						There are three main pillars of intrinsic motivation. Autonomy: The urge to direct our own lives. Mastery: The desire to get better and better at something that matters. Purpose: The yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves.</p>
					<p>He also had a good example: Microsoft tried to create an encyclopedia, but the people had extrinsic motivation, so it did not go well. Wikipedia is the opposite: It does not offer money to edit it, but the people who do that are passionate about what they are doing, and they are intrinsically motivated.</p>

				<p>Opinion on the result: I consider myself impulsive in some decisions, but when there is a severe matter at stake, I remain <b>calm and
					cool-headed.</b>
					I am a bit <b>maximalist</b>, so if someone or I set a goal for myself, I always <b>try my best</b> to reach it. There are cases when it does
					more harm than improvement.
					I like to spend time with my friends, but I need to spend <b>time with myself</b> as well. It is essential for me.</p>
				<img src="motivation1.png" alt="Chart about my motivation" width="1400">
				<p>Opinion on the result: I tend to disagree with that I am a reward-oriented person. I believe the opportunity to <b>grow and be better</b> is
					my strongest motivation. And of course the <b>fun</b> from the activity I do.</p>
				<img src="motivation2.png" alt="Chart about my motivation" width="1400">
				<p>Opinion on the result: I genuinely <b>hate failure</b>, and as I mentioned above, I tend to be a bit maximalist.
					I am precise in order to avoid failures whenever it is possible. But if I need to <b>get out of my comfort zone</b>,
					I will go and do whatever is have to be done.
					These things, however, usually causes stress for me.
				</p>
				<img src="motivation3.png" alt="Chart about my motivation" width="1400">
				<p>To sum up, I mostly agree with the outcome of the test. I was always this maximalist at high school too, but only when the
					subject was interesting. I surely need fun the keep my motivation, and I need direct orders. My 5-year side job in Hungary with MÁV required
					the same; I got a direct order, and I had to be precise. I wouldn't say I like giving orders.
					For me, it can be a lot of unnecessary responsibility.
					On the other hand, I like tasks when I have responsibility and control.</p>

							<h2>Most important anchors</h2>
							<p><b>Structure: </b>I need structure in my life and my work as well. When there is a structure, I do not feel lost. I like, when the orders are direct and exact.
								I need to understand my role, my responsibilities in advance in order to be able to work independently and structurally.</p>
							<p><b>Performance: </b>For me, performance is highly important, whatever I do. This is my intrinsic motivation. I mentioned above that I am a bit maximalist. I always want to do
								my job in the best possible way.
								I believe if you want to outstand from the crowd, you need to offer more for your company or clients than the others.</p>
							<h2>Less important anchors</h2>
							<p>For me, autonomy and work-life balance are less critical. 
                                As I mentioned, I do not mind getting orders, and I wouldn't say I like to lead. I do not want to be accountable for other people's mistakes.
                                As for the work-life balance, I feel more productive during the night. I am a night owl. In my previous job at MÁV I had to work sometimes
                                at night, sometimes I had to start quite early.
                                I enjoyed it because it was diverse.</p>
