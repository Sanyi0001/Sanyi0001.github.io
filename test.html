			<h2>Past</h2>
				My name is Sanyi Zeke, I'm 20 years old, and I have one brother. I followed the standard Hungarian education path. After that, I could choose between mathematics and informatics. I preferred mathematics over informatics because I thought it could give me the basics of logical thinking that I will need during this course. After high school, I decided to go to the Netherlands and attend to HZ because it is relatively small.

			<h2>Now</h2>
			I favor this over the huge universities because you are not just a number in the teachers' system. Another advantage is that HZ is a practical university, not a theoretical one. In my opinion, it is essential to do practice over the years you spend in the university to be able to find a job quite fast.
