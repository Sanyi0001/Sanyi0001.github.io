		<h1 id="tmobile">T Mobile</h1>
		<p class="profession">T mobile NL is a part of the magenta-colored multinational company Deutch telecom.
		   They serve individuals and businesses as well. They have 1450 employees in the Netherlands, which is considered a lot. 
		   Because this sector is changing rapidly, they need to make quick decisions; therefore, they have many positions open to ICT people.
		   Applying for these jobs is relatively easy since they have an online application interface that allows you to upload your CV and motivation letter.</p>
		<p>Several different positions open currently, such as Linux Engineer, a universal job, Cybersecurity specialist, a more skilled job,
		   or a Webcare specialist, which is somewhere between. Their primary focus, of course, is continuously innovating their GSM network
		   across the globe.</p>
		<p>However, it seems that their customers are not satisfied with their service: on Trustpilot,
		   they got 1.5 points out of 5, which is an awful score.</p>
		<p>They use open-space working environments, a common way of working in offices nowadays when employees have to communicate frequently.
		   They have several recreation rooms for the employees, for playing games, or having an afternoon nap.
		   They even can get a massage for a reduced price or drink free coffee. I think T mobile strongly focuses on their employees' wellbeing.</p>
		<p>The company also wants to make its working-methods greener; they continuously develop solutions to stay a carbon-free company.
		   In my opinion, this is a vital thing to do nowadays.</p>
		<p>For me, the Cyber Security Specialist position is charming because those people are continually monitoring T mobile assets and providing
		   support and advice to the business to implement and safeguard security in their products and services.
		   Additionally, I like the fact that they focus on their employee's wellbeing as well.</p>
